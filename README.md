# Generate secure and unique passwords in bulk

## How does this work?
I dont use password managers. Instead, I save my passwords in a gpg encrypted file and extract passwords with a bash script every time i need to use them. Passwords are saved in a array of json objects. I change my password twice a year. Once after the gregorian new year ie Jan 1 and once after the Bikram Sambat new year ie Baishakh 1. This script will incorporate both of the calendars, my usernames, names of the services along with my super secret keys to create unhackable passwords that I do not need to remember. 

## Feel free to use this recepie
Please ditch your password manager and use my scripts for saving and retreiving passwords. Message me for more info!
